## PCB for ESP32 Vroom + 2 Mikrobus modules + 2 groves connectors (RXTX,I2C)
This PCB is designed to support a ESP32 devkit board and 2 MiKroBus modules.

The purpose of this board is to control mikrobus modules including SX1280 technology that will transmit and receive messages on a 2.4GHz radio frequency. Each module are connected to a ESP32 which will be connected to the wifi.

Mikrobus board is an add-on board socket standard made by [mikroe](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus)
 ![MiKroBus module](https://github.com/thingsat/tinygs_2g4station/blob/main/MiKroBus_module%20-%20Pinout_specification.PNG) 

Both Mikrobus boards are connected to the ESP 32 by SPI:


	MiKroBus 1: SPI_0			MiKroBus 2 :SPI_1
	CLK     IO18				CLK	IO14
	MISO	IO19				MISO	IO12
	MOSI  	IO23				MOSI  	IO13
	NSS     IO5				NSS     IO15
	


Mikrobus 1 is also connected to the ESP32 by a RESET (IO27) and a BUSY(IO27) line.

Connector grove available on board :


	I2C:					UART serial link (Rx/Tx):
	SDA   IO21				CLK	IO14
	SCL   IO22				MISO	IO12



Two UFL connected to a SMA mount edge connector are available to plug an antenna. Theyâ€™re disconnected from the rest of the board, which allows to connect the module that you want to the antenna, with a UFL -UFL connector.
