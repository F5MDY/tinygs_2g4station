# Board_Tinysgs_2.4GHz_V1

This board is the firts version of the 2.4GHz gateway
Contain Schematic and PCB file for ESP32 Vroom + 2 Mikrobus modules + 2 groves connectors (RXTX,I2C).

This Board is designed to support a ESP32 devkitC-V4 and 2 MiKroBus modules. This board is the firts version of the 2.4GHz tinygs ground station gateway and named Board_V1

The purpose of this board is to control mikrobus modules including SX1280 technology that will transmit and receive messages on a 2.4GHz radio frequency. Each module are connected to a ESP32 which will be connected to the wifi.

Mikrobus board is an add-on board socket standard made by [mikroe](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus)

Both Mikrobus boards are connected to the ESP 32 by SPI:


	MiKroBus 1: SPI_0			MiKroBus 2 : SPI_1
	CLK     IO18				CLK	IO14
	MISO	IO19				MISO	IO12
	MOSI  	IO23				MOSI  	IO13
	NSS     IO5				NSS     IO15
	


Mikrobus 1 is also connected to the ESP32 by a RESET (IO27) and a BUSY(IO25) line.

Connector grove available on board :


	I2C:					UART serial link (Rx/Tx):
	SDA   IO21				CLK	IO14
	SCL   IO22				MISO	IO12



Two UFL connected to a SMA mount edge connector are available to plug an antenna. Theyâ€™re disconnected from the rest of the board, which allows to connect the module that you want to the antenna, with a SMA -UFL connector.



#### Library and footprint

Lib & empreinte folder contains all necessary symbol and footprint for the project:
* ESP32 symbol and footprint. Footprint has been changed to match with our ESP32-devkitC-V4
* Mikrobus (mikroe-2439) symbol and footprint
* Grove connector for I2C and RxTx connection
* SMA and UFL connector



#### Files
* .pro: File containing the parameters of the project.
* .sch: Schema files.
* .kicad_pcb: Printed circuit board files.
* sym-info-cache: Library list file (symbol library table): declaration of component symbol libraries available for the schema editor.
